        Are you a sunflower? Because you brighten up my day.
        Are you a tulip? Because I’m stuck in the petals of your idiotness.
        Are you a daisy? Because I’m crazy about you.
        Are you a rose? Because you make my heart bloom.
        Are you a daffodil? Because you make me feel like spring has sprung.
        Are you a lily? Because you’re as elegant and beautiful as one.
        Are you a hibiscus? Because you’re stunningly handsome and exotic.
        Are you a marigold? Because you’re bold and vibrant.
        Are you a cactus? Because you’re tough and resilient, yet still a charmer.
        but If you were a flower, you’d be a damndelion—beautiful, wild, and hard to resist.
